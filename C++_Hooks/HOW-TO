HOW-TO

Build libhook.cpp with:
$ g++ -fPIC -shared -ldl -lstdc++ "$1" -o "$2"

Copy ./hooks.so to where ever.
$ cp ./hooks.so ./tmp/hooks.so

Set environment var to allow preloading.
$ export env LD_PRELOAD="/tmp/hooks.so"

Run the helloworld example to see how much shit actually got hooked.


----- NOTES ------
some libc calls don't trigger function hooks depending
on if they go through the PLT:
