HOW-TO

Build libhook.cpp with:
$ gcc -fPIC -shared -ldl ./libhook.cpp -o ./hooks.so

Copy ./hooks.so to where ever.
$ cp ./hooks.so ./tmp/hooks.so

Set environment var to allow preloading.
$ export env LD_PRELOAD="/tmp/hooks.so"

Run the helloworld example to see how much shit actually got hooked.
